# MATLAB_interpreter

## Motivation
Over the past decade, the functionality of open access Python packages have accelerated rapidly, repicating nearly all of the functionality of proprietary scientific software like MATLAB, with similar stability. This project was initiated to help scientists using MATLAB port their code to Python.

## Installation
Clone the app to your local machine and run the parser using:
```
python matlab_rewrite.py
```
or
```
python test_driver.py
```
Make sure to change the hard-coded user input in these files before running.

## Files
* [matlab_lexxer.py](matlab_lexxer.py) - A lexxer module that tokenizes input MATLAB scripts
* [matlab_parser.py](matlab_parser.py) - A parser module that creates a parse tree of tokens from the lexxer
* [matlab_rewrite.py](matlab_rewrite.py) - Interprets the parser tree from the parser to either write the MATLAB script in Python or just evaluate it (run it directly). Is currently set up to run the parser in every '.m' file within a directory tree
* [test_driver.py](test_driver.py) - Script used to import and test the parser at the rewrite level (tests for the lexxer and parser can be found at the ends of those files)
* [io_util.py](io_util.py) - A module of utility functions. Currently only has code to walk through a directory tree to apply matlab_rewrite file-by-file
* [parsetab.py](parsetab.py) and [parser.out](parser.out) - Files automatically generated by the parser pipeline
* [convertDn2RadAll.m](convertDn2RadAll.m) - Example, not great MATLAB script for testing

## Dependencies
This project was written in Python 2. Many of the dependencies may be old/broken.

* The file [io_util.py](io_util.py) uses code written by [Robin Parmar](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/users/99666/)
* This project is based on the final project (writing a web browser) in a (now defunct) [Udacity course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs262)

# TODO

* Saving and loading .mat files and using the functions 'load' and 'save'

* Regular expressions translation from MATLAB to Python

* Add/verify cell and struct functionality

* Add automatic listing of functions for each output file for which user has to manually find and implement replacements in Python
